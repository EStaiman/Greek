This project was done completely in Prolog. I recommend installing SWI-Prolog to query.

In browser, you can utilize 
https://swish.swi-prolog.org/ 

 

Here is how to install:

Windows

Go to https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable
Click the download for Windows 32-bit or 64-bit depending on your OS
Run the installer
Follow the instructions on the installer

Mac

Go to https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable
Click the Mac download
Open the .dmg file
Drag everything into application folder

Linux

In command line, type sudo add-apt-repository ppa:swi-prolog/stable
Next, type: 
sudo apt-get update
Finally, type
sudo apt-get install swi-prolog


Once installed, the .pl file extension will be associated with Prolog. The code itself has no dependencies, so once downloaded it is ready to use. So, after downloading the code, you can simply open it in and it will by default bring you into the swipl application with the file loaded in. From there, you can begin querying. 
In Linux, simply navigate to the location of the file and type
swipl greek.pl


To edit from swipl, type
edit(greek.pl).

If you want to edit this project in an IDE, I recommend Atom, as there is downloadable Prolog support. Just make sure to run 
make. 
after every change to compile the file.
